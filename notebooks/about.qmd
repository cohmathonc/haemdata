Welcome to **Haemdata Notes**, a platform for publishing analytical notebooks making use of Haemdata. 

In addition to *cohort reports*, it would be great if we can collect complete analyses or short examples and snippets of code in notebooks - Jupyter, Quarto, Rmarkdown, or a multitude of other formats. 

The website is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a powerful scientific publishing platform that supports Python, R, Julia, and Observable JavaScript, and many other languages via Jupyter notebooks, for example.
