EGAD00001003891,Transcriptome sequencing of myelodysplasia,Transcriptome sequencing was performed on 214 patients with myelodysplasia in this study. RNA was obtained from bone marrow CD34+ cells (n=100) and/or bone marrow mononuclear cells (n=165). Transcriptome sequencing was performed for both cell fractions in 51 patients. A total of 211 patients were genotyped by targeted deep sequencing. We also studied bone marrow CD34+ cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells obtained from three healthy adults each.,"{""Exome sequencing"",""Transcriptome profiling by high-throughput sequencing""}","{""Illumina HiSeq 2500""}",266,controlled,,f,t,2018-01-29 01:00:00+01,f,EGAP00001000607,EGA00001394467,2018-01-04 03:12:24+01,2018-01-26 07:16:12+01
