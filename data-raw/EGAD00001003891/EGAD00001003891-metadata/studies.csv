EGAS00001002346,Transcriptome sequencing of myelodysplasia,Transcriptome sequencing was performed on 214 patients with myelodysplasia in this study. RNA was obtained from bone marrow CD34+ cells (n=100) and/or bone marrow mononuclear cells (n=165). Transcriptome sequencing was performed for both cell fractions in 51 patients. We also studied bone marrow CD34+ cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells obtained from three healthy adults each.,Transcriptome sequencing was performed on 214 patients with myelodysplasia in this study.
