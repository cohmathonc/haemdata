Multiple references are used throughout the project, be sure to know which one you are using:

* GRCm38_HLT ([GRCm38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001635.20/), Ensembl annotation version 81, July 2015)
* GENCODEm28_HLT ([GRCm39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001635.27), Gencode annotation release 28, Dec 2021) 

### GRCm38_HLT

This is the veneralble `mm10` reference genome, used for the [*Cancer Research*](https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0354) and [*Science Advances*](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj1664) papers. 
It was originally released in January 2012 and is no longer updated. The version used here was downloaded from Illumina's [iGenomes](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html) in 2017.

### GENCODEm28_HLT

This June 2020 genome build (GRCm39) is paired with GENCODE annotation M28, released Dec 2021. Both were downloaded from https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/release_M28.html in Jan 2022.

### Additional human leukemic transgenes ("HLT")

Additional human leukemic transgenes are concatenated to genome fasta files and included in the indexes used by *STAR* and *Salmon*.

### Availibility

Genome reference files (`fasta`, `gtf`, `star`, `salmon`) are located on the Isilon store, and can be accessed via the HPC at `/ref_genome/igenomes/Mus_musculus/Ensembl/GRCm38_human_leukemic_transgenes` and `/ref_genome/igenomes/Mus_musculus/GENCODE/ReleaseM28_HLT`.
