This package uses git tags to "stamp" different releases, useful for tracking both the 
nf-core pipeline version and the genome reference used for a build. A release is made
whenever new data are added, or when the pipeline or genome reference is updated.

Currently the "latest" release points to a patchwork of nf-core/rnaseq pipeline versions 
3.5 or 3.6 and the GRCm38_HLT reference. An upcoming release of the package uses 
pipeline version 3.7 and the GENCODEm28_HLT reference - stay tuned.
