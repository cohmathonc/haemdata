The package uses git tags to "stamp" different releases, useful for tracking both the 
nf-core pipeline version and the genome reference used for a build. A release is made
whenever new data are added, or when the pipeline or genome reference is updated.

Currently the "latest" release uses nf-core/rnaseq pipeline version 
3.7, Cellranger 6.1 and GENCODEr40, GENCODEm28_HLT & GRCm38_HLT references.
