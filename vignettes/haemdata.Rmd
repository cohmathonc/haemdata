Haemdata provides a simple interface to the genomic data generated by or of interest to the PSON State transition project at COH, and a complete record of how it was processed from fastq to abundance.

The [Rstudio {`pins`}](https://pins.rstudio.com/) package publishes data and other R objects to Microsoft OneDrive, making it easy to access Haemdata from any computer with internet access. Pins are version controlled, making it easy to track changes between updates, re-run analyses on historical data, and undo mistakes.

To use the pins package, you need to install it.

```{r}
install.packages("haemdata", repos = "http://cgt.coh.org/MHO")
```

If you have an account on the [COH HPC](http://hprcc.coh.org/); you can skip the hassle of installation by using [RStudio Server for Bioconductor]() on the cluster.
