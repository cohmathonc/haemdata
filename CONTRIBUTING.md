# Contributing to Haemdata
We love your input and want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Adding an Rmarkdown or Jupyter notebook
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Raw data remains at COH
We don't store any raw, unprocessed genomic data in this repository.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track bugs, fixes and features. Reports can be made by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
If you use the [`rbioc`](https://github.com/drejom/devcontainer_RbioC) development environment, `lintr` is already set up.
